# Debug

Debug enables to dump information about errors that may be affecting the software functionality. If Chevereto isn't working properly you must start debugging it.

## Configuring debug

Debug can be configured using [environment](../../setup/system/environment.md#debug-variables) variables or using the [settings file](../../setup/server/settings-file.md).

### Debug level

Depending on your work context you may need to configure debug accordingly.

::: warning
Error level >= 2 is not recommended for production environments. It is not safe to print the errors to the screen, handle it with care.
:::

| Level | Description                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0     | No debug                             |
| 1     | Debug to `log_device`                |
| 2     | Print errors (no logging)            |
| 3     | Print errors and log to `log_device` |

Use `CHEVERETO_DEBUG_LEVEL=3` or add the following to your `app/settings.php` file:

```php
$settings['debug_level'] = 3;
```

### Log device

Configure your own error log device to control where the logs will be sent. If you don't alter this it will fallback to the default system log device.

::: tip Containers
Containers will always log to `/dev/stderr` regardless this setting.
:::

Use `CHEVERETO_ERROR_LOG=log_device` or add the following to your `app/settings.php` file:

```php
$settings['error_log'] = 'log_device';
```

## Accessing logs

To access logs you will need to know first the location for those. If you don't configure debug Chevereto will follow the default [error_log](https://www.php.net/manual/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-log) handling configured for your PHP installation.

### Where are the default logs?

This vary a lot depending the server provider and how PHP runs in the server. In doubt, check first with your service provider.

* PHP
  * Logs by default at `syslog`
* Apache
  * Logs by default at `/var/log/apache2/error.log`
  * Virtual host directive defines custom error log location
  * Commonly configured for `/var/www/domain.com/logs`
* NGINX
  * Logs by default at `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
  * Server block defines custom error log location
  * Commonly configured for `/var/www/domain.com/logs`
* cPanel
  * Logs by default at `../domain.com.error.log` (parent of `public_html` folder)
  * Vary a lot from providers and cPanel version
* Docker
  * Logs to `/dev/stderr`

### I can't find the logs

You can configure `debug_level` >= 2 but note that such error reporting level **could compromise** your installation. Restrict any public access to your website and revert back to `debug_level=1` as soon as possible.

If you can't find the logs or you are having a hard time with this you can request [extra support](https://chevereto.com/support) so we can safely debug your installation.

### Reading logs

Logs can be easily accessed by direct file access or by running commands accordingly.

<code-group>
<code-block title="Shell">
```sh
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log | sed 's/\\n/\n/g'
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="Docker">
```sh
docker logs -f container-name | sed 's/\\n/\n/g'
```
</code-block>
</code-group>

## Error reporting

::: warning Not for production!
Enable this is recommended only in development environments.
:::

To enable printed error reporting you will need to go to [system settings](../../settings/system.md). By enabling this all the runtime errors will be printed which means that they will be visible.
